# Expense tracker

## An app built with React

This is my first real React exercise.

**Deployment:**

[https://GreetVdL.github.io/expensetracker](https://GreetVdL.github.io/expensetracker).

**Functionality:**

In the app you can add and remove expense items, see a list of your items and see the total amount spent.
